# What's this?

This is a MATLAB application designed to visualize Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and Aerosol Particle Sizer (APS) data in an easy to read contour plot! SMPS and APS are used to sample aerosolized particles ranging from 3 – 680nm, while the APS covers 0.5 – 10 µm sized particles (measurements based on particle diameter). With a contour plot, one can easily visualize the amount of particles (color axis) and their respective diameter sizes (vertical axis) across a given sampling time (horizontal axis).

# How to use

It's simple! Open up Particle_Visualizer.m and hit run! You will need MATLAB installed in your computer in order to make use of this application, however.

Once the application fires up, you should see a window pop up. You can then click on the SMPS browse or APS browse button, depending on which type of file you wish to plot. Select your input file, and watch your data come to life!
You can adjust the graphing resolution by the drop down menu on the lower-left corner too. If you wish to select another file, hit browse again and select another file.

# Wanna demo?

I've included some demo files in this repo! Feel free to play around with them. Otherwise, here's a screenshot of what the output looks like!
